Build a Full Stack CRUD App using PostgreSQL, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js (PERN Stack).

⚡ What I’ve done:

✓ Set up PostgreSQL for efficient database management.

✓ Build a backend with Express.js and Node.js to handle API requests.

✓ Created a frontend using React.js to build a responsive and interactive user interface.

✓ Implemented CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations to manage data in your app.

✓ Connect the front and back ends to create a fully functional full-stack application.
